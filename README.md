This fork is on the same update schedule as Bluefin (once per day) as opposed to the upstream Bazzite's weekly update cadence. This fork will always recieve the upstream weekly updates in addition to automatic scheduled updates. Due to Bazzite's large package base, not all automatic builds are successful. A failed build above does not mean that ALL the images in the build failed. Click the badge above and click on the latest build to see what images failed.

### Desktop

Common variant available as `bazzite`, suitable for desktop computers.

- Automatic updates for the OS, Flatpaks, and all Distrobox containers - powered by [ublue-update](https://github.com/ublue-os/ublue-update) and [topgrade](https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade).

Rebase from an existing upstream Fedora Atomic to this image if you want **Open Source GPU Drivers**:
(Please note: Mesa's Open Source option for NVIDIA GPUs, NVK is still prone to errors at the time of writing, for any issues relating to NVK [please submit a report with Mesa]([url](https://docs.mesa3d.org/bugs.html)), not Ublue/Bazzite)

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite:stable
```

or for devices with Nvidia GPUs wanting the **NVIDIA Proprietary Drivers**:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-nvidia:stable
```

**For users with Secure Boot enabled:** Follow our [secure boot documentation](#secure-boot) prior to rebasing.

### Steam Deck/Home Theater PCs (HTPCs)
> [!IMPORTANT]  
Devices that are NOT the Steam Deck can still use the `bazzite-deck` images, but must use a modern AMD GPU. Intel Arc GPUs also have been confirmed to work.

Variant designed for usage as an alternative to SteamOS on the Steam Deck, and for a console-like experience on HTPCs, available as `bazzite-deck`:

- Directly boots to Game mode matching SteamOS's behavior.
- **Automatic `duperemove` greatly trims the size of compatdata.**
- **Latest version of Mesa creates smaller shader caches and does not require them to prevent stutter.**
- **Able to be booted even if the drive is full.**
- **Support for every language supported by upstream Fedora.**
- **Uses Wayland on the desktop with [support for Steam input](https://github.com/Supreeeme/extest).**
- Includes [HHD](https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd) for expanded input support on non-Valve handhelds.
- Features ported versions of most SteamOS packages, including drivers, firmware updaters, and fan controllers [from the evlaV repository](https://gitlab.com/evlaV).
- Patched Mesa for proper framerate control from Gamescope.
- Comes with patches from [SteamOS BTRFS](https://gitlab.com/popsulfr/steamos-btrfs) for full BTRFS support for the SD card by default.
- Ships with a ported copy of [SDGyroDSU](https://github.com/kmicki/SteamDeckGyroDSU), enabled by default.
- Option to install [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader), [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/), [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/), and [ProtonUp-Qt](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/), among numerous other useful packages on installation.
- Custom update system allows for the OS, Flatpaks, and Distrobox images to be updated directly from the Game mode UI powered by [ublue-update](https://github.com/ublue-os/ublue-update) and [topgrade](https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade).
- Built in support for Windows dual-boot thanks to Fedora's installation of GRUB being left intact.
- Update break something? Easily roll back to the previous version of Bazzite thanks to `rpm-ostree`'s rollback functionality. You can even select previous images at boot.
- Steam and Lutris preinstalled on the image as layered packages.
- [Discover Overlay](https://github.com/trigg/Discover) for Discord pre-installed and automatically launches in both Game mode and on the Desktop if Discord is installed. [View the official documentation here](https://trigg.github.io/Discover/bazzite).
- Uses ZRAM<sub><sup>(4GB)</sup></sub> with the ZSTD compression algorithm by default with the option to switch back to a 1GB swap file and set a custom size for it if desired.
- [LAVD](https://crates.io/crates/scx_lavd) and [BORE](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler) CPU Schedulers for smooth and responsive gameplay.
- Kyber I/O scheduler to prevent I/O starvation when installing games or during background `duperemove` process.
- Applies SteamOS's kernel parameters.
- Color calibrated display profiles for matte and reflective Steam Deck screens included.
- Default-disabled power-user features, including:
    - Service for low-risk undervolting of the Steam Deck as well as AMD Framework Laptops via [RyzenAdj](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj) and [Ryzen SMU](https://gitlab.com/leogx9r/ryzen_smu), see `ryzenadj.service` and `/etc/default/ryzenadj`.
    - Service for limiting the max charge level of the battery, see `batterylimit.service` and `/etc/default/batterylimit`. <sup><sub>(Works even when the device is off)</sub></sup>
    - Built in support for display overclocking. For example, add `CUSTOM_REFRESH_RATES=30-68` to `/etc/environment`. Minimum and maximum refresh rates differ per handheld!
    - 32GB RAM mod your Steam Deck? Enjoy double the maximum VRAM amount, automatically applied. <sup><sub>(Can you share your soldering skills?)</sub></sup>
- Steam Deck hardware-specific services can be disabled by running `ujust disable-bios-updates` and `ujust disable-firmware-updates` in the terminal. These are automatically disabled on non-Deck hardware, and on Decks with DeckHD displays or 32GB RAM mods.
- More information can be found [here](https://docs.bazzite.gg/Handheld_and_HTPC_edition/Steam_Gaming_Mode/) on the Bazzite Steam Deck images.

Rebase from an existing upstream Fedora Atomic to this image:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-deck:stable
```

#### Alternative Handhelds

Please refer to our [Handheld Wiki](https://docs.bazzite.gg/Handheld_and_HTPC_edition/Handheld_Wiki/) for required setting changes and Decky Loader plugins for Steam Gaming Mode on your specific Handheld.

**Be sure to also read the [hhd documentation](https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd#after-install), some handhelds require specific setting changes/tweaks to function properly.**

We also ship `ujust` commands to install various [CSS Loader](https://docs.deckthemes.com/CSSLoader/Install/#linux-or-steam-deck) themes that can't be found on the CSS Loader store. These will be automatically updated with Bazzite if installed.
```bash
# Install Handheld Controller Theme (https://github.com/victor-borges/handheld-controller-glyphs)
ujust install-hhd-controller-glyph-theme
```

### GNOME

Builds with the GNOME desktop environment are available in both desktop and deck flavors. These builds come with the following additional features:

- [Variable refresh rate support and fractional scaling enabled under Wayland](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1154).
- Custom menu in the top bar for returning to game mode, launching Steam, and opening a number of useful utilities.
- [GSConnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/) preinstalled and ready to use.

## Verification

These images are signed with sigstore's [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` key from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/apoordev/bazzite
```

## Secure Boot

> [!WARNING]  
> **Steam Deck Users: The Steam Deck does not come with secure boot enabled and does not ship with any keys enrolled by default. Do not enable this unless you absolutely know what you're doing.**

Secure boot is supported with our custom key. The pub key can be found in the root of this repository [here](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/secure_boot.der).
If you'd like to enroll this key prior to installation or rebase, download the key and run the following:

```bash
sudo mokutil --timeout -1
sudo mokutil --import secure_boot.der
```

For users already on a Universal Blue image, you may instead run `ujust enroll-secure-boot-key`.

If asked for a password, use `universalblue`.
